Welcome to our AWS Generative AI Showcase! This C# Blazor application demonstrates various use cases of generative AI powered by Amazon Web Services. Explore the cutting-edge capabilities of AI and machine learning through practical, interactive examples.

## Introduction
This repository contains sample code demonstrating various use cases leveraging Amazon Bedrock and Generative AI with .NET. Each sample is a separate project with its own directory, and includes a basic Blazor frontend to help users quickly set up a proof of concept.

This application showcases the following generative AI use cases:
- Chat interfaces
- Document generation
- Image analysis
- Image generation
- Image search (text-based and similarity-based)
- Amazon Bedrock Knowledgebases
- Custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solutions
- Text generation
We leverage powerful AWS services to bring these features to life, including:
- Amazon Bedrock LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Amazon OpenSearch Serverless
- Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases
- Amazon Bedrock Agents
Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or simply curious about the potential of generative AI, this application provides hands-on experience with some of the most exciting technologies in the field.
